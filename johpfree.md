Hi, my name's JP Freeman, a 22 year old Computer Science student currently
in my junior year. I joined this class as a requirement for my major, but
I'm excited to get to work with others on a project we all have a similar
interest in. I am a digital artist and I love playing games, so if possible,
being on a team with others focusing on a sort of game design would be
something I would like to be a part of.
