I am a UTK computer science student with a background in full-stack software development, backend systems, and applied problem-solving through both academic coursework and real-world projects.



I’m interested in building reliable software systems, automation, and data-driven applications, and for the class project I’d like to work on a project involving backend development, APIs, or an end-to-end application with real users or real data.
