My name is Adam Martin and I am a Computer Science student looking to also expand a bit into hardware to be well rounded. I worked a bit in the software industry for a bank on the mechant processing side before returning to school.
I'm going for a minor in Cybersecurity so I'm very interested in either a project based around security or one based around an open source Instruction standard set like the currently Popular RISC-V.
