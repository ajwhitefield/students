Hello, my name is Henry Centeno! I am taking this class to get my B.S. in computer science.
I do enjoy the software development process, but I hope to pursue a career in research or development.
I mainly enjoy playing with my cat, going on walks, and art. I am looking forward to what this class has to 
offer!
