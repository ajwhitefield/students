I am Surya Teja Mazundar, an international sophomore at Tickle College of Engineering, majoring in Computer Science with minors in Cybersecurity and Machine Learning. 
I immigrated to the United States in 2022 for academics. As of my current project, I am developing an automation software for UTK's housing department 
and waiting on an approval for a centralized administration. So, I would like the group project to be something that would make the university's or an organization's software 
or duties more efficient. In other words, anything that would possibly be a solution to a real-world problem or advancement!
If you would like to join me on this journey, please contact me at smazunda@vols.utk.edu.
